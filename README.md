## 1. Introduction

This project demonstrates a real-time gesture prediction system leveraging the **STMicroelectronics IKS4A1 Sensor X-NUCLEO-IKS01A4 expansion board** and an **STM32L412RB-P microcontroller board**. We collected a custom dataset of various gestures, trained our own machine learning model to recognize these gestures, and then deployed the model onto the STM32L412RB-P for on-device inference. The system aims to provide an intuitive and efficient way to interact with devices or applications through hand gestures.

## 4. Project Overview

Provide a high-level explanation of the different stages of your project.

### 4.1. Data Acquisition

Describe how you collected the raw sensor data from the IKS4A1 using the STM32.

We developed a firmware for the STM32L412RB-P to read raw accelerometer and gyroscope data from the IKS4A1 sensor at a high sampling rate. This data was then streamed over a serial (UART) connection to a host PC. A Python script on the PC was used to capture and log this incoming sensor data.

### 4.2. Dataset Creation

Explain how you processed the raw data to create your custom dataset for gesture recognition.

After collecting raw data for each intended gesture, the data was pre-processed. This involved:
* **Segmentation:** Isolating individual gesture instances from continuous data streams.
* **Labeling:** Assigning the correct gesture label to each segment.
* **Normalization/Scaling:** Applying techniques like Min-Max scaling or Standardization to the sensor readings.
* **Feature Extraction:** (If applicable) Briefly mention if you extracted features like mean, variance, peak-to-peak, etc., or used raw time-series data.
The resulting dataset, containing features/raw data and corresponding labels, was stored in a [CSV/Numpy array/other format] file.

### 4.3. Machine Learning Model

Detail your ML model. What type of model is it? How was it trained?

We developed a custom machine learning model for gesture prediction.
* **Model Type:** [e.g., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)].
* **Training:** The model was trained using the custom dataset created in the previous step. We employed standard machine learning practices, including data splitting (training, validation, test sets), hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to optimize model performance.
* **Framework:** [e.g., `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`/`Keras`].
* **Quantization/Optimization (if applicable):** If you optimized the model for embedded deployment (e.g., TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers), mention this here.

### 4.4. Embedded Implementation

Explain how the trained model was deployed onto the STM32.

The trained machine learning model was converted into a format suitable for deployment on the STM32L412RB-P. This typically involves:
* **Model Conversion:** (If using neural networks) Converting the model to TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (`.tflite`) format.
* **Code Generation:** Using tools like X-CUBE-AI (for STM32CubeIDE) or custom C code to integrate the model's inference engine into the embedded firmware.
* **Real-time Inference:** The STM32 firmware now continuously reads sensor data, performs the same pre-processing steps as during training, feeds the processed data to the embedded ML model, and outputs the predicted gesture.

## 5. Setup and Installation

Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to set up the hardware and software.

### 5.1. Hardware Connections

Describe how to connect the IKS4A1 to the STM32L412RB-P. If it's a shield, just state that.

The IKS4A1 (X-NUCLEO-IKS01A4) expansion board can be directly stacked onto the STM32L412RB-P Nucleo board using the Arduino Uno-compatible connectors. Ensure proper alignment before pushing down firmly.

### 5.2. Software Setup

Instructions for installing necessary software and Python libraries.

1.  **STM32CubeIDE:** Download and install STM32CubeIDE from the STMicroelectronics website.
2.  **Python:** Install Python [Version] from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
3.  **Python Libraries:** Open a terminal or command prompt and install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow pyserial matplotlib seaborn
    # Add any other specific libraries
    ```
4.  **[Optional] Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab:**
    * For Jupyter: `pip install jupyter` and then `jupyter notebook` to launch.
    * For Google Colab: Access through your Google account.

### 5.3. Flashing the STM32

How to compile and flash the firmware to the STM32.

1.  **Open Project in STM32CubeIDE:**
    * Navigate to `[Path to your STM32CubeIDE project folder]/[Project Name]`.
    * Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.
2.  **Build Project:**
    * Go to `Project` -> `Build Project` (or click the hammer icon).
3.  **Flash to Board:**
    * Connect the STM32L412RB-P board to your computer via USB.
    * Go to `Run` -> `Debug` (green bug icon) or `Run` -> `Run` (green play icon). This will typically build and flash the firmware. Ensure the correct ST-Link programmer is selected in the debug configuration.

## 6. Usage

How to use your project once it's set up and running.

Once the STM32 firmware is flashed and running:

1.  **[Describe how the embedded system behaves]:** The STM32 will start acquiring sensor data and performing gesture inference.
2.  **[How to see the output]:**
    * If using serial output: Open a serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY, Termite, or the serial monitor in Arduino IDE if you're comfortable with it) connected to the STM32's virtual COM port (check Device Manager for the COM port number, usually `STMicroelectronics STLink Virtual COM Port`). Set the baud rate to `[Your Baud Rate, e.g., 115200]`. You should see predicted gestures being printed.
    * If using LEDs/display: Observe the LEDs or the connected display for gesture indications.
3.  **Perform Gestures:** Perform the gestures you trained the model on (e.g., wave, clap, swipe left/right, etc.). Observe the system's response.

## 7. Results
