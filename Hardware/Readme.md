This zip contains the basic interfacing of sensor on STM board , i have also included app_mems.c file which will be needed for use in ML application
## STM32CubeIDE Project for IKS4A1 Sensor & STM32L412RB-P

This folder contains the firmware project for an STM32L412RB-P Nucleo board, designed to interface with the IKS4A1 (X-NUCLEO-IKS01A4) Sensor Expansion Board.

The project is packaged as a `.zip` file: `Iks4a1 on stm L412RB.zip`.

### Project Overview:
This STM32CubeIDE project specifically handles:
* [**Briefly describe the STM32's role, e.g.,** "Reading accelerometer and gyroscope data from the IKS4A1."]
* [**And its output, e.g.,** "Sending this sensor data over UART to a host PC for further processing."]

### Hardware Used:
* STM32L412RB-P Nucleo Board
* IKS4A1 (X-NUCLEO-IKS01A4) Sensor Expansion Board
* USB Cable

### Software Required:
* STM32CubeIDE 

### Getting Started:

1.  **Download:** Click the green "Code" button on this GitHub page and select "Download ZIP".
2.  **Extract:** Unzip the downloaded `Iks4a1 on stm L412RB.zip` file to your preferred directory.
3.  **Import to STM32CubeIDE:**
    * Open STM32CubeIDE.
    * Go to `File` > `Open Projects from File System...`.
    * Click `Directory...` and browse to the extracted project folder (the one containing `.project`, `.cproject` files, etc.).
    * Click `Finish`.
4.  **Build & Flash:**
    * Connect your STM32L412RB-P board with the IKS4A1 stacked on top to your PC via USB.
    * In STM32CubeIDE, click the **hammer icon** (Build) to compile the project.
    * Click the **green play icon** (Run) to flash the firmware onto your board.

### Usage:

Once flashed, the board will start [**state what it does, e.g.,** "outputting sensor data" or "performing gesture recognition"].

* **To view output:** Open a serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY, Termite) connected to the STM32's Virtual COM Port (check Device Manager for COM port) at a baud rate of `[Your Baud Rate, e.g., 115200]`.
* [**Add any simple user interaction, e.g.,** "Perform your trained gestures to see predictions." or "Observe the data stream."]
